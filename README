= Raisin =

The purpose of Raisin is to retrieve and build from source everything
needed for a good Xen installation. Today that includes at least Xen,
Grub and Libvirt. It can be used to quickly setup a Xen development
environment.  Optionally it can also install and configure the system
for you.

Raisin is meant to be easy to read so that it can be used as a guideline
on how to build and configure the system.
