RAISIN CODING STYLE
===================


Shell version compliance
------------------------

Raisin requires BASH 3.2 or newer, use BASH features accordingly.


Indentation
-----------

Use four spaces to indent.


Line width
----------

Lines are limited to 80 characters.


Functions
---------

Use the function keyword and () to define a function. Place the opening
brace on the same line and the closing brace on a line by itself.
Example:

function do_something () {
    echo something
}

Prepend _ to the function name if it is a local function.


Tests
-----

[[ is preferred for tests.


Subshell
--------

Use `` to execute a command in a subshell.


Numeric tests
-------------

Use $(( )) for calculations.


Awk
---

Use bash 3 features, cut, tr and sed instead of awk when possible.


Block structure
---------------

for loops, place do on a new line:

for i in $LIST
do
    echo do something
done


if statements, place then on a new line:

if [[ -z "$VAR" ]]
then
    echo do something
fi
