RAISIN CODING STYLE
===================


Shell version compliance
------------------------

Although we are requiring bash to run at the moment, please don't make
assumption on the bash version available. Use modern features only when
no older constructs do what you need.


Indentation
-----------

Use four spaces to indent.


Line width
----------

Lines are limited to 80 characters.


Functions
---------

Use the function keyword and () to define a function. Place the opening
brace on the same line and the closing brace on a line by itself.
Example:

function do_something () {
    echo something
}


Tests
-----

Use "test" to make a test. Do not use [. Do not use [[ unless you have a
good reason.


Subshell
--------

Use `` to execute a command in a subshell.


Numeric tests
-------------

Use expr for calculations.


Awk
---

Use cut, tr, bash 4+ and sed instead of awk when possible, in this order.


Block structure
---------------

for loops, place do on a new line:

for i in $LIST
do
    echo do something
done


if statements, place then on a new line:

if test -z "$VAR"
then
    echo do something
fi
